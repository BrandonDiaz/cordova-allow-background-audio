# Allow Background Audio for iOS

Started work on a plugin that allows background audio to continue running while a cordova app is running based on the answer to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14122363/iphone-app-allow-background-music-to-continue-to-play?lq=1

This is work-in-progress, as I ran out of time to finish implementing. For now I hard code the change every time I rebuild cordova (ugh).

Originally based on https://github.com/AubreyHewes/cordova-background-audio, which does the opposite: allows your audio to run in the background when not in focus.
